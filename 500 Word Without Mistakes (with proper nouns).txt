The Professor’s Discovery

Professor Elliot Carter had spent decades unraveling the mysteries of time. As a leading physicist at Westbridge University, his office was a maze of books, chalkboards filled with equations, and stacks of research papers. His latest project - one he barely spoke of - had the potential to change everything.

One evening, long after students had left the campus, Professor Carter sat at his desk, staring at a small device no larger than a pocket watch. It had taken years of theoretical work, grant proposals, and failed prototypes, but this one - this one might actually work.

He took a deep breath and pressed the activation button.

A faint hum filled the room. The device vibrated slightly in his palm, emitting a soft blue glow. The numbers on his wall clock flickered. For a moment, nothing else seemed different. Then he noticed the coffee cup on his desk. The steam, which had been curling lazily upward, suddenly reversed, flowing back into the cup as if time had rewound itself.

Carter’s heart pounded. He grabbed a pen and dropped it. The moment it hit the desk, it leaped back into his fingers as if it had never fallen. His theory had been correct.

He had built a time manipulator.

His mind raced with possibilities. Would it allow him to travel through time or only affect small, localized events? Was it safe? What would happen if he tried it on himself?

His fingers hovered over the device. Testing on objects was one thing; testing on himself was another entirely. But Professor Carter had never been one to let fear outweigh curiosity.

Adjusting the settings carefully, he set the device to a thirty-second reversal. If something went wrong, at least it wouldn’t be permanent. He took a deep breath and pressed the button.

At first, nothing happened. Then the world around him seemed to ripple. The pen flew back into his hand, his chair scooted itself under the desk, and a sentence he had just written on his notepad vanished from the page.

Then, something unexpected happened.

He heard footsteps in the hallway - his own footsteps. His past self was walking toward the door. The realization hit him like a shockwave. The device had not just reversed time; it had duplicated him within that window.

He turned to the doorway just as the handle turned. The door creaked open, and there he was - himself - standing frozen in the threshold.

For a long moment, the two professors stared at each other. Then, just as quickly as he had appeared, the past version of himself flickered and vanished, time snapping back into place.

Professor Carter sat down, shaking. His invention was far more powerful than he had realized.

A nervous excitement bubbled inside him. He had just glimpsed what no human had ever witnessed.

The future of time itself was in his hands.
