"""
Retrieves the text file and dictionary file names either from command-line arguments 
or by prompting the user for input.

If command-line arguments are provided, the function expects the first argument to be 
the text file and the second to be the dictionary file. If no arguments are given, 
the user is prompted to enter the filenames manually.

Args:
    arguments:  A list of command-line arguments, where the first element is the script
                the second is the text file, and the third is the dictionary file.

Returns:
    tuple:
        text_file: The name of the text file.
        dict_file: The name of the dictionary file.

Raises:
    SystemExit: If no command-line arguments are provided and user input is not received.
